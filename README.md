displaying word informations, getting a random word, etc. WordWizard additionally
provides a random word every load-up, custom and unique word games, and other
accessibility features.

## Target Browsers
Our target audience is very broad, as anyone may need or use a dictionary. 
Our website will serve as a valuable resource for students, writers, 
educators, and anyone interested in expanding their vocabulary and understanding 
of the English language. Our target browser is mainly Google Chrome, however, we
hope to expand to other browsers and devices.
