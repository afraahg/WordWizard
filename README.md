# WordWizard
### INST377 Group Project

## Description
WordWizard aims to create a dictionary website through the use of APIs. We 
include standard dictionary website functionalities such as searching for words,
displaying word informations, getting a random word, etc. WordWizard additionally
provides a random word every load-up, custom and unique word games, and other
accessibility features. 
### Games
#### WordChain game
Users will create a word train using the last letter of a word to start a new word.
Users are timed for a certain amount of time to enter a word, the longer the 
chain of words, the more points the user will get. 
#### Type racer game
Users quickly type words after given a definition. After a word is correctly 
entered, a new definition is displayed and the user will continue playing. The 
more words correctly guessed/the longer the streak, the more points the user will get.
#### Syn/Ant-onym
Users are given a definition and must answer a synonym and antonym to the word. 
After a synonym and antonym is guessed, another definition will be displayed for 
the user to guess. Points are given for each word definition.

## Target Browsers
Our target audience is very broad, as anyone may need or use a dictionary. 
Our website will serve as a valuable resource for students, writers, 
educators, and anyone interested in expanding their vocabulary and understanding 
of the English language. Our target browser is mainly Google Chrome, however, we
hope to expand to other browsers and devices.
